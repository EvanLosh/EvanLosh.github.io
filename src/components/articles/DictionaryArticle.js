                <p>The Github repo for this project is temporarily private. Please check again later.</p>

                <p>This web app, created by a team of myself and a fellow bootcamp student, allows users to lookup definitions of words using Merriam-Webster's public API. Users can save a list of words, and all words the user views are saved in a separate list. These lists persist on a mock JSON server.</p>
                <p>This project was an exercise in pure javascript. There are forms, event-listeners, client-server communication, CRUD actions, and DOM manipulation all programmed without any frameworks or libraries.</p>
