                <p>MeetMe users can create and edit appointments, invite other users to appointments, view their schedule on a dynamic calendar, and interact with events on the calendar.</p>
                <p>This web app is another team project from my bootcamp experience. Four students including myself built a full-stack application. We created our back-end with a relational database, a many-to-many relationship, data validations, an ORM, and an API. And we created a front-end with React, Formik, and NPM's react-big-calendar package.</p>
